Module 6 submission for UC Berkeley data science bootcamp.

This project structures and analyzes data pertaining to employee records of a theoretical company from the 1980s and 1990s. The salient information has been retained only in a series of six `.csv` files to which we have been granted access.

For this project, we have instnatiated a relational database, designed a schema to hold the employee data, populated the data tables, and then answered a series of salient questions that the C-suite has about employment during this window. The components of this project are laid out in more detail below.
